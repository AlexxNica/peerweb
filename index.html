          In the hosting business, they call this 100% uptime. Websites are shared among a globally distributed network of computers. Whether you want to upload your resume, a photo album, or host your company's official website,  it will remain available to the world even when you go offline.
          <br>
          <br>
          As long as someone is willing to share your content, it will always be available.

          With just a few clicks, you can share your website directly from your personal computer. Your friends, customers, or anyone can then view and help share your website, increasing uptime and reducing the strain on your network. All of this without having to spend a dollar on hosting or having to manage a server.

          We can't all be techno-wizards like the people on TV or that nephew who goes to MIT. PeerWeb doesn't expect us to be. If you know enough about technology to use a web browser, like Google Chrome or Firefox, you know enough to use PeerWeb.
